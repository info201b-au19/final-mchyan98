# Project Brainstorm
*Derrick Sin, Jin Lin, Micheal Chyan & Sydney Lee*

## Focus
### Music
*We chose this topic because music has become an integral part of people's daily lives and we are interested in the types of music people are listening to these days as well how it may affect them. Other than that, it is intriguing to learn about why certain songs are more popular than others and how certain platforms create playlists based on the data they have.*

### Previous Projects
- [Music Consumer Insight Report](https://www.ifpi.org/downloads/music-consumer-insight-report-2018.pdf)

 *This report gives us an insight of the music listening habits from a sample of 19,000 participants.*

- [Audio Monitor](https://musicbiz.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AM_US_2018_V5.pdf)

 *This project took a dive into looking at the overall music consumption habits of the average person.*
 *It took look at which devices were more popular between different age groups, which platform (e.g youtube, pandora, spotify) was used more often, and other music comparative information.*

- [Music Psychology](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797618759465)

 *This psychology investigates what makes certain songs more popular than others. It specifically focuses on unique lyrics within a certain genre of music.*
